Because we're using viewsets instead of views,
we can automatically generate the URL conf for our API,

Again, if we need more control over the API URLs,
we can simply drop down to using regular class-based views, and writing the URL conf explicitly.

Finally, we're including default login and logout views for use with the browsable API.
That's optional, but useful if your API requires authentication and you want to use the browsable API.
