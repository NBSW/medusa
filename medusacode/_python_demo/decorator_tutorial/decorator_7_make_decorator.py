"""
As you can see, you can pass arguments to the decorator like any function using this trick.
You can even use *args, **kwargs if you wish.
But remember: decorators are called ONLY ONCE. Just when Python imports the script(when you decorate a function).
You can't dynamically set the arguments afterwards.
When you do "import x", the function is already decorated, so you can't change anything.
